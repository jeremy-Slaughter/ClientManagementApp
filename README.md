# ClientManagementApp
Web App to manage client services for back office services


This App is setup to get data from a database to auto populate options to help manage client services for a back office company.  
The company wanted to be able to send the data to the database and have it print to excel in a specific format.  
 

They wanted to be able to select an option and have other options be displayed from there.

They previously had it where an employee would just manually type out what they did which provided a form that was inconsitent and hard to manage.  

This will provide only specific options and save each option as a new line in the database with the company code
